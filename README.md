# neural-net-regression

This is the code used to optimize the weights of an under-parameterized neural network.
Training is done via gradient flow using MLPGradientFlow.jl (https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10638). 
In this repo, we release the code to train and visualize the result of training for the erf 
activation function and standard Gaussian input data (https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01644).
