# neural-net-regression

This is the code used to optimize the weights of an under-parameterized neural network.
Training is done via gradient flow using MLPGradientFlow.jl. 
In this repo, we release the code to train and visualize the result of training for the erf 
activation function and standard Gaussian input data (https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01644).
